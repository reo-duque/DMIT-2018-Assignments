## Queries

In this assessment, you are required to implement simple Linq queries. Place each answer in a single LinqPad Query. Please uncomment all of your code so that your instructor can run it without having to edit the file.   Your instructor will inform you on how and where to submit your files (all queries in one file). You **must** commit to each question as you complete it.

Your instructor will supply the database so that you can test your answers. You will need to restore the back-up to your machine. The ERD of the database is attached to the end of this document.

You may have access to your computer, MS SQL and LinqPad. You may access to your notes and samples.

The supplied images for each question, indicate the needed data to be reported and what your results should look like.
